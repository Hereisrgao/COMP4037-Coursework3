The calculus represents the regulation of agents\u2019 choices using utility functions that take account of context. Associated with the calculus is a (Hennessy\u2013Milner-style) context-sensitive modal logic of state. As an application, we show how a notion of \u2018trust domain\u2019 can be defined for multi-agent systems.",

        "abstract": "To reveal farmers\u2019 motives for on-farm diversification and integration of farming components in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, we developed a fuzzy logic model (FLM) using a 10-step approach. Farmers\u2019 decision-making was mimicked in a three-layer hierarchical architecture of fuzzy inference systems, using data of 72 farms. The model includes variables for family motives of diversification, component integration, production factors, and farmers\u2019 appreciation of market prices and know-how. Calibration and validation show that the model has good classification performance, especially for land-based activities. The study concludes that hierarchical fuzzy logic models are effective tools for integrating subjective decision-making criteria and can support strategic agricultural planning at higher levels.",

        "abstract": "The practical utility of agent-based models in decision-making relies on their capacity to accurately replicate populations while seamlessly integrating real-world data streams. Yet, the incorporation of such data poses significant challenges due to privacy concerns. To address this issue, we introduce a paradigm for private agent-based modeling wherein the simulation, calibration, and analysis of agent-based models can be achieved without centralizing the agents\u2019 attributes or interactions. The key insight is to leverage techniques from secure multi-party computation to design protocols for decentralized computation in agent-based models. This ensures the confidentiality of the simulated agents without compromising on simulation accuracy. We showcase our protocols on a case study with an epidemiological simulation comprising over 150,000 agents. We believe this is a critical step towards deploying agent-based models to real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Collective, especially group-based, managerial decision making is crucial in organizations. Using an evolutionary theoretic approach to collective decision making, agent-based simulations were conducted to investigate how human collective decision making would be affected by the agents\u2019 diversity in problem understanding and/or behavior in discussion, as well as by their social network structure. Simulation results indicated that groups with consistent problem understanding tended to produce higher utility values of ideas and displayed better decision convergence, but only if there was no group-level bias in collective problem understanding. Simulation results also indicated the importance of balance between selection-oriented (i.e., exploitative) and variation-oriented (i.e., explorative) behaviors in discussion to achieve quality final decisions. Expanding the group size and introducing non-trivial social network structure generally improved the quality of ideas at the cost of decision convergence. Simulations with different social network topologies revealed collective decision making on small-world networks with high local clustering tended to achieve highest decision quality more often than on random or scale-free networks. Implications of this evolutionary theory and simulation approach for future managerial research on collective, group, and multi-level decision making are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Modelling of complex systems is mainly based on the decomposition of these systems in autonomous elements, and the identification and definition of possible interactions between these elements. For this, the agent-based approach is a modelling solution often proposed. Complexity can also be due to external events or internal to systems, whose main characteristics are uncertainty, imprecision, or whose perception is subjective. Insofar as fuzzy logic provides a solution for modelling uncertainty, the concept of fuzzy agent can model both the complexity and uncertainty. This paper focuses on introducing the concept of fuzzy agent: a classical architecture of agent is redefined according to a fuzzy perspective. A pedagogical illustration of fuzzy agentification of a smart watering system is then proposed.",

Simulation scenarios were based on a proposed charging/discharging model for an AIV battery. The results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive fuzzy multi-agent models in optimizing charging strategies, improving operational efficiency, and reducing energy consumption. Dynamic factors such as workload variations and AIV-infrastructure communication are taken into account in the form of heuristics, underlining the importance of flexible and collaborative approaches in autonomous systems.",

        "abstract": "The majority of multi-agent system implementations aim to optimise agents\u2019 policies with respect to a single objective, despite the fact that many real-world problem domains are inherently multi-objective in nature. Multi-objective multi-agent systems (MOMAS) explicitly consider the possible trade-offs between conflicting objective functions. We argue that, in MOMAS, such compromises should be analysed on the basis of the utility that these compromises have for the users of a system. As is standard in multi-objective optimisation, we model the user utility using utility functions that map value or return vectors to scalar values. This approach naturally leads to two different optimisation criteria: expected scalarised returns (ESR) and scalarised expected returns (SER). We develop a new taxonomy which classifies multi-objective multi-agent decision making settings, on the basis of the reward structures, and which and how utility functions are applied. This allows us to offer a structured view of the field, to clearly delineate the current state-of-the-art in multi-objective multi-agent decision making approaches and to identify promising directions for future research.",

This paper presents a novel methodology that integrates fuzzy logic and Monte Carlo simulation into agent-based models to simultaneously address both types of uncertainty. A fuzzy Monte Carlo agent-based simulation model is developed to assess construction crew performance by incorporating deterministic, random, and subjective variables. The model is validated using field data collected from an industrial construction project in Canada. Results show that this integrated model offers improved prediction accuracy for construction crew performance, highlighting its practical potential for construction planning, decision-making, and productivity assessment.",

        "abstract": "Agent-based models are particularly suitable to reflect the dynamics of humans, nature, and their interactions, making them a crucial approach for understanding social-ecological systems. The formalisations of human decision-making are central to resulting model behaviours. Despite awareness of the complexity of human behaviour in social-ecological systems research, scholars tend to represent human decision-makers as simplified, perfectly informed rational optimisers, without explicitly considering the fit with decision context. Key reasons are a lacking uptake of social theories and insights. To advance, we need a practice of reflecting, sharing, and inquiring on the justification of the decision model fit with its context. This paper stimulates this practice by 1) supporting the justification of decision model (DM) fit by describing the DM landscape and providing guiding questions; and 2) by supporting researchers in considering alternative DMs through a survey-based impression of modeller practices, and through highlighting DM frontiers as inspiration for future research.",

The aim is to investigate how users interact with space and how spatial and environmental components influence user movement patterns. The model incorporates fuzzy logic to interpret observational and environmental data into attractiveness values, which in turn define the attraction forces in an agent-based simulation. The approach is applied to a real-world case study of Konak Square in Izmir, Turkey, using observation data, environmental simulations, and fuzzy inference systems. The simulation results are validated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Secant Cosine Calculation, achieving over 80% accuracy.
